# precision-recall-plot
Generate a Precision-Recall Plot from a text file.
This Python script creates a function pr_plot() which can be used to generate a high quality (dp=1200) precision-recall plot..
..for your trained deep learning model (typically YOLOV3/4/5).
Please make sure that your generated result.txt file contains only comma seprated values in the form of list. If your model.. 
..only generates a single text file then make sure to create a two separate text files for precision and recall.
This also saves generated plots in your root directory.
